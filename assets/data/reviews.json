      "text": "Absolutely delicious!! The Katsu Chicken was absolutely delightful - they use all chicken breast meat, not thighs, so there wasn‚Äôt any stringy or gummy meat at ALL!! Which is my sole complaint about other Katsu chicken places. I love the crust and the sauce; but have to compromise and eat meat I don‚Äôt love. No more compromising at Good Grindz!! I also tried the garlic chicken which was absolutely ridiculously good. And their Mac salad was the best I think I‚Äôve ever had. This is my new fav spot for Hawaiian food üòÅ",

The staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming, which is all indicative of the aloha spirit. Whether you‚Äôre stopping by for a quick bite or sitting down for a full meal, it always feels like a treat. Their garlic chicken and guava cake is so ono! So happy to have a place like this in the community. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "Fun Hawaiian place out in Salem. We spoke with the owner who was super friendly and made sure we had enough sauce. The Hawaiian food was on point and tasted great (I got some pineapple with my mac salad and the juice gave it a bit of extra vim). As a Brit ‚Äúchips and gravy‚Äù from a Fish and Chips shop is something I deeply miss from home. The gravy and curry sauce that come with the fries were spot on flavour and consistency wise and were a real joy. The only thing missing was the malt vinegar! I will be back again.",
